	<p class="info">Cancer (â™‹) is the fourth astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the constellation of Cancer. In astrology, Cancer is considered a "feminine", negative (introvert) sign. It is also considered a water sign and is one of four cardinal signs.[2] Cancer is ruled by the Moon. Being the fourth sign in the zodiac, Cancer has been associated with the astrological fourth house. Individuals born when the Sun was in this sign are considered Cancerian individuals. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun enters Cancer on the moment of summer solstice by definition, or roughly on June 21, leaving it around July 22. In western astrology, this sign is no longer aligned with the constellation as a result of the precession of the equinoxes[citation needed], and thus according to the more accurate sidereal zodiac, the Sun enters Cancer from roughly July 16 until August 15.</p>
    <p class="info">According to an ancient Greek legend, the figure of a crab was placed in the nighttime sky by the goddess Hera to form the constellation Cancer. Hera swore to kill Heracles, the most famous Greek hero. Hera attempted to kill Heracles in many different ways, but each time his incredible physical strength allowed him to survive. Hera cast a spell of madness on Heracles, causing him to commit a great crime. In order to be forgiven, he had to perform twelve difficult tasks. One of these tasks was destroying the terrible nine-headed water-serpent, Hydra.
During the battle between Heracles and Hydra, the goddess Hera sent a crab to aid the serpent. But Heracles, being so strong, killed the crab by smashing its shell with his foot. As a reward for its service, Hera placed the crab's image in the night sky.</p>
