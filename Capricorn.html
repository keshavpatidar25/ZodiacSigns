	<p class="info">Capricorn (â™‘) is the tenth astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the constellation of Capricornus. In astrology, Capricorn is considered an introvert sign.[2] It is also considered an earth sign and one of the four cardinal signs. Capricorn is ruled by the planet Saturn. Being the tenth sign of the zodiac, Capricorn has been associated with the astrological tenth house. Individuals born when the Sun was in this sign are considered Capricorn individuals. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun enters Capricorn by definition at the moment of winter solstice, or roughly at December 21, and leaves it around January 20. In western astrology, this sign is no longer aligned with the constellation as a result of the precession of the equinoxes.[citation needed] Under the sidereal zodiac, it is currently there roughly from January 15 to February 15.</p>
    <p class="info">Generally, the natives of Capricorn are considered to be compatible with the natives of the other earth signs, Taurus and Virgo, and the natives of the water signs, Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. Aries and Libra are signs of the other nature (masculine/extroverted), but are considered semi-compatible with Capricorn due to them having the same cardinal quality.
There are many variables that determine compatibility in astrology, such as birth dates, birth months, birth years, sign within the Sun, the Moon, Stars. The signs listed as compatible with Capricorn do not reflect an individual profile or individual reading as interpreted within astrology, but rather reflect a general guideline and reference to compatibility as dictated by variables such as Qualities and Elements within the Zodiac. The branch of astrology dealing with interpersonal compatibilities is called Synastry. It was once believed that the capricorn birth sign was the sign of Nadia.</p>
