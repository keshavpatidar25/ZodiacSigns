	<p class="info">Virgo (‚ôç) is the sixth astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the constellation of Virgo. In astrology, Virgo is considered a negative (introvert) sign. It is also an earth sign and one of four mutable signs. Virgo is traditionally ruled by the planet Mercury, although Ceres has been suggested as the ruler of Virgo by some modern astrologers. Being the sixth sign of the zodiac, Virgo has been associated with the astrological sixth house.
Individuals born when the Sun was in this sign are considered Virgo individuals. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun is in Virgo roughly from August 23 to September 23, leaving it at the moment of autumnal equinox, by definition. Under the sidereal zodiac, it is currently there roughly from September 13 to October 30. In western astrology, the sign is no longer aligned with the constellation as a result of the precession of the equinoxes.</p>
    <p class="info">In Greek mythology Astraea was the virgin-goddess of justice. During the Golden Age she dwelt upon the earth with humankind, but was driven away by the lawlessness of the later Bronze Age. Zeus then placed her amongst the stars as the Virgo constellation along with her scales of justice, Libra constellation.</p>
