	<p class="info">Aries (English pronunciation: /ˈeə.riːz/; meaning "ram") is the first astrological sign in the Zodiac, named for the constellation of Aries, called "The Ram" in Hellenistic tradition, after the golden ram that rescued Phrixos, taking him to the land of Colchis. Aries is ruled by the planet Mars. Being the first sign in the zodiac, Aries is associated with the astrological first house. In Western astrology, Aries is often considered a "masculine", positive (extrovert) sign. It is also considered a fire sign, and is one of four cardinal signs.. Birthstone is the diamond.
Individuals born when the Sun was in this sign are called Arians or Ariens. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun enters Aries on the moment of vernal equinox by definition on March 20, leaving it on or about April 20. Under the sidereal zodiac, it is currently there roughly around April 15 and May 15. In western astrology, this sign is no longer aligned with the constellation as a result of the precession of the equinoxes.</p>
    <p class="info">In Hellenistic astrology, the constellation of Aries is associated with the golden ram of Greek mythology that rescued Phrixos, taking him to the land of Colchis. Phrixos sacrificed the ram to the gods and hung its skin in a temple, where it was known as the Golden Fleece.</p>
