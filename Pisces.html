	<p class="info">Pisces (â™“) is the twelfth astrological sign in the Zodiac, which started from the Pisces constellation.
It is also considered a water sign and one of the four mutable signs. Pisces has been traditionally ruled by the planet Jupiter, but since its discovery, Neptune has been considered a modern ruler of this sign. Being the twelfth sign, Pisces is associated with the astrological twelfth house.
Individuals born when the Sun was in this sign are considered Pisceans. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun is in Pisces roughly from February 19 to March 20, ending on the moment of vernal equinox by definition. In western astrology this sign is no longer aligned with the constellation because of the precession of the equinoxes. Under the sidereal zodiac, it is currently there roughly from March 14 to April 18.</p>
    <p class="info">According to one Greek myth, Pisces represents the fish into which Aphrodite and her son Eros transformed in order to escape the monster Typhon; they are tied together with a cord on their tails, to make sure they do not lose one another. Alternatively, the twin fish were placed in the heavens in honor of their heroic deed of saving Aphrodite and Eros from Typhon on the river Euphrates.</p>
