	<p class="info">Gemini (Gem-en-i.e.) (♊) is the third astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the constellation of Gemini. In astrology, Gemini is considered a "masculine", positive (extrovert) sign. Perhaps the most dominant Geminian characteristic is versatility. It is also considered an air sign, and is one of four mutable signs.[4] Gemini has been closely associated with the planet Mercury and is considered to be ruled by it. A planet god known for its intelligence, awakening, cleverness, wiseness, high education, wise man, or sage.[5]
Being the third sign of the zodiac, Gemini has been associated with the astrological third house.
Individuals born when the Sun was in this sign are considered Gemini individuals. Under the tropical (western) zodiac, Sun is in the sign of Gemini roughly from May 22 to June 20, ending at the moment of summer solstice by definition. In western astrology, this sign is no longer aligned with the constellation as a result of the precession of the equinoxes.[citation needed] Under the sidereal zodiac, it is currently there roughly from June 15 to July 15. The Sanskrit name of Gemini in Hindu astrology is Mithuna.</p>
    <p class="info">Gemini were the twin brothers Castor and Pollux in Greek mythology, also sometimes known as Iabal and Ivbal.[6] They were the sons of Leda by Tyndareus and Zeus respectively. They were also the brothers of Helen of Troy and Clytemnestra. They are known collectively in Greek as the Dioscuri (Greek: Διόσκουροι, Dioskouroi) "sons of Zeus." Loki, the trickster figure from Norse mythology, is often associated with Gemini and its ruling planet Mercury.</p>
