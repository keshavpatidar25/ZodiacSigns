	<p class="info">Taurus (â™‰) is the second astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the constellation of Taurus. In astrology, Taurus is considered a negative (introvert) sign.[2] It is also considered an earth sign and one of the four fixed signs. Taurus is ruled by the planet Venus (which also rules Libra). Being the second sign of the zodiac, Taurus has been associated with the astrological second house. Individuals born within the period when the Sun was in this sign are considered Taurus individuals. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun is in Taurus roughly from April 20 to May 21. In sidereal astrology, this sign is no longer aligned with the constellation as a result of the precession of the equinoxes.</p>
    <p class="info">In Greek mythology, Taurus was identified with Zeus, who assumed the form of a magnificent white bull in order to seduce Europa, a legendary Phoenician princess. In illustrations, only the front portion of this constellation are depicted; in Greek mythology this was sometimes explained as Taurus being partly submerged as he carried Europa out to sea. Greek mythographer Acusilaus marks the bull Taurus as the same that formed the myth of the Cretan Bull, one of The Twelve Labors of Hercules.</p>
