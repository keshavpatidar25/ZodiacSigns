	<p class="info">Leo (â™Œ) is the fifth astrological sign of the Zodiac, originating from the constellation of Leo. In astrology, Leo is considered to be a "masculine", positive (extrovert) sign. It is also considered a fire sign and is one of four fixed signs[2] ruled by the Sun. Being the fifth sign of the zodiac, Leo has been associated with the astrological fifth house.
Individuals born when the Sun is in this sign are considered Leo individuals. Under the tropical zodiac, Leo is occupied by the Sun from July 23 to August 22 Under the sidereal zodiac, it is currently there roughly from August 10 to September 15. Leos also have a second animal, which in fact is the Tiger. Leos are the dominant Zodiac sign, and are the strongest of the years.</p>
    <p class="info">Generally, the natives of Leo are considered to be compatible with the natives of other fire signs, Aries and Sagittarius,and the natives of the air signs, Gemini, Libra and Aquarius. Taurus and Scorpio are signs of the other nature (feminine/introverted), but are considered semi-compatible with Leo due to them having the same fixed quality.
There are many variables that determine compatibility in astrology, such as birth dates, birth months, personalities, birth years, times of birth (specific), position of a sign within the Sun, the Moon, Stars, etc. The signs listed as compatible with Leo do not reflect an individual profile or individual reading as interpreted within astrology, but rather reflect a general guideline and reference to compatibility as dictated by variables such as Qualities and Elements within the Zodiac.[3] The branch in astrology dealing with interpersonal compatibilities is called Synastry.
Side info (Leo Horoscope): Men born on that day always give true love, and are the only ones known to risk their lives for the people they love.</p>
