	<p class="info">Scorpio (♏) is the eighth astrological sign in the Zodiac, originating from the constellation of Scorpius. Scorpio is considered a feminine, negative (introverted) sign by most modern astrologers. It is also considered a water sign and one of the four fixed signs.[2] The planet Pluto is the ruler of Scorpio. As the eighth sign in the zodiac, Scorpio is associated with the astrological eighth house. The lower arrow pointing up in the Scorpio symbol represents the venomous tail of the Scorpion or claw of wolf.
Individuals born when the Sun is in this sign are considered Scorpio individuals and are extremely powerful. Under the tropical zodiac, the Sun enters Scorpio on October 23 and exits on November 22. Under the sidereal zodiac, it is currently there roughly from November 16 through December 15. The Sanskrit name of Scorpio in Hindu astrology is Vṛścika.</p>
    <p class="info">Generally, the natives of Scorpio are considered to be compatible with the natives of the other water signs, Cancer and Pisces, and the natives of the earth signs, Taurus, Virgo and Capricorn. Leo and Aquarius are signs of the other nature (masculine/extroverted) but are considered semi-compatible with Scorpio due to them having the same fixed quality.
There are many variables that determine compatibility in astrology, such as birth dates, birth months, birth years, position of a sign within the Moon, Stars, etc. The signs listed as compatible with Scorpio do not reflect an individual profile or individual reading as interpreted within astrology, but rather reflect a general guideline and reference to compatibility as dictated by variables such as Qualities and Elements within the Zodiac.[3] The branch of astrology dealing with interpersonal compatibilities is called Synastry.</p>
